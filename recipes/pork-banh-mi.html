        <p>Steps</p>
       <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Toss julienned daikon and carrot with seasoned rice vinegar to coat well. Let sit until veggies get slightly limp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and set aside or refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Mix the mayonnaise, hoisin sauce, and sriracha in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Split the French roll just enough so you can open it like a book. If you like, pull out some of the bread from the top half to better accommodate the filling.</li>
            <li>Spread the interior surfaces of the roll liberally with the mayo mixture. Transfer roll to prepared baking sheet, cut side up. Bake in preheated oven until crisp, heated through and edges start to brown, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place sliced pork, pate, cucumber, picked daikon and carrots, jalapeno, and cilantro leaves in the roll. Cut in half to serve.</li>
       </ol>
